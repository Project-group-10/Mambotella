    <p>Coming to ALU was a big leap into my leadership journey as it is profoundly known to emulate a unique form of learning to produce all round individuals equipped with both entrepreneurial and leadership skills.
    </p>
    <br>

    <p>Right from admission, we were guided into the ALU culture with a rigid one-week orientation filled with valuable lessons and activities surrounding the schools belief and core principles with a heavy emphasis on its motto; Missions, not majors. 
        It is notable that as you embark on your degrees and learning journey, ALU fosters this in a number of ways. 
        Your entrepreneurial journey begins with self-directed learning especially during the first year in which all students undertake a foundational course known as Leadership Core.</p>
        <br>

    <p>With it was a comprehensive list of modules I undertook such as Data and decisions which was about seeking and analyzing different types of data to make informed decisions when addressing real world problems and Global Challenges in which I learnt how to describe, analyze, and solve challenges while exploring opportunities to transform Africa in a global context using asset-based thinking and growth mindset. 
        Having such a solid foundation laid the ground for me to expand my perspective about my continent and what it takes to really make a difference.
</p>
<br>

    <p>ALU has embedded ownership within its core values such that it is incumbent for someone to take ownership of their own journey. 
        This is heavily supported by the ALU student Ventures Program which was designed to give students an opportunity to explore their entrepreneurial ambitions through giving us resources to support our startups and businesses. 
        One advantage about being in ALU is realizing that it gives one an opportunity to access a wide network of collaborators and people from vast business niches to guide you in whatever pursuits you may have. 
        Such an example is through the various workshops I attended with talks from professionals in big industries from which I gained my passion in Data Science. </p>
        <br>

    <p>It is also important to mention that studying at ALU has given me an opportunity for career development and guidance. 
        The academic year here consists of a mandatory internship period whose main goal is to expose us to the work environment while at the same time building our resumes thus giving us higher employability chances upon graduation. 
        There are also work-study opportunities within the school that expose me to learning how to balance my work and academics while giving me a platform to grow both professionally and personally. 
        I have been able to serve as a Peer Counselor during my first year and was also able to work with the Student Life and Operations Department in my second year. 
        As such, I can say that my leadership journey has so far been filled with numerous learning opportunities and substantial support from the ALU community.</p>

<div class="story-text">
    <p> I am Fousseni Traore an Ivorian student from Abidjan the economic capital city of Cote dâ€™Ivoire. 
        I attended secondary school at one of the most prestigious high schools in the political capital before moving to Abidjan for a diploma in finance and accounting. 
        I worked as an accountant intern in two companies and also try a small business before I realized that there was something missing in my life.</p>
    <br>

    <p> After some thought, I realized that I have a strong passion for technology, leadership, and education. 
        I decided to pursue this career path further in those sectors. My passions led me to many youth and leadership associations at school and in my community. 
        In September 2019, I co-founded with a friend an association of young students in my neighborhood to promote education and excellence in the community. 
        The vision is to create a model for children so that they do not have the idea of dropping out from school and pursuing the wrong path</p>
        <br>

    <p> In 2020, I heard through a friend that the African Leadership University was opening a new session of the application. 
        I first heard about ALU in 2015, when some instructors came to my high school to present the vision and the mission of the school. 
        I had other plans at this time, so I did not apply. But in 2020, I made thorough research about it and realized that the vision was matching with my ambition of making a change in my community. 
        It was a huge opportunity for me to join ALU at this moment of my life when I was starting a new step in my life. 
        I found a purpose in my life which was to serve the people around me. 
        What other place than ALU could have been better to fulfil this kind of ambition?</p>
        <br>

    <p>After some research, I started gathering all the necessary documents for the application. 
        This step was a bit challenging because of the language barrier. 
        I had to complete all the admission processes and the scholarship requirements in English. 
        I first proudly got the admission and I was feeling very excited to know that I was about to realize my dream. 
        A few months later, I received an email from the ALC Mauritius campus stating that I had been awarded a full scholarship. 
        This was the result of many years of engagement in my community and my desire to become a changemaker.
</p>
<br>
    <p> The idea of joining the ALU community was omnipresent in my mind. 
        I could wait a long to leave and start the ALU dream. 
        I was thinking about the school, and other students coming from all over the continent. 
        My research about Mauritius was showing me a beautiful country with nice sunny beaches. 
        We finally took off in January 2021 for Mauritius with the other Ivorian admitted students. 
        After twos longs weeks of quarantine, we moved to the ALC campus. It was very exciting to see all those students and to know that some of them will be my friends, classmate or roommate. 
        But happiness met my English barrier once again and I knew that it would be easy to communicate with them at the beginning except for those coming form a French-speaking country like me. 
        Fortunately, my fellow students were patient and were also interesting in discussing with us. My strategy was to interact as much as possible with students in English in order to speak the language frequently and get used to it. 
        The school also provide all the learning environment for us to learn and speak English. All those efforts allow me to understand English only after a few weeks. 
        I was able to converse with others students in the school and even make new friends. My attempts to comprehend the language also enabled me to collaborate with peers on a variety of coursework. 
        Working with peers gave us a great opportunity to share our experiences and learn from one another because we all have diverse backgrounds and life experiences. 
        I got the opportunity to work with several fantastic and extremely intelligent colleagues, from whom I learned new approaches to problem-solving and also share my experience.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>Mauritius is a nice island with a lot of places to visit. With a small group of friends, we decided to visit the best Mauritian places. 
        Every weekend we used to pick a place on the map and visit it together. Before we reach the weekend we all make a proposition of place and choose according to our preference and our budget. 
        Once the is chosen, we organize ourselves and go using google Maps and the Mauritian buses. 
        We often got lost during the exploration even with the map, something we were not expected but it used to make the experience more interesting as we were hunting a treasure. 
        The school is a bit isolated from the city, the people and their culture. Therefore, going out allowed me some time to discover the culture of the country and the people in addition to the beauty of the country. 
        Unlike in college, I had no linguistic barriers with Mauritanians because most of them know French. As I engaged with them more, I came to the conclusion that they were just like their country: kind, and generous. 
        They are always the first to start the conversation trying to know where you come from and to know more about you. 
        This amazing experience because it allowed me both to discover the country, and the people and to strengthen my relationship with my new friends.</p>
        <br>


    <p> I made a transition from finance and accounting to computing in order to begin a career as a machine learning engineer. 
        Artificial intelligence and machine learning are particularly appealing to me because they enable numerous human actions. 
        In order to tackle issues more effectively, I would like to include this system in software or embedded systems that I will work on. </p>

    <p>I had just finished high school and I was waiting for my results. 
        In the meantime I was just at home trying to make applications to several universities outside my home country. 
        ALU was one of my very first applications. 
        Once I received my results I submitted my application. Countless of essays I wrote, I did not think I would get in. 
        A few months later I received a full ride scholarship to go to one of the most beautiful islands. 
        It is said that heaven was copied after Mauritius. Indeed it was true.
        
    </p>
    <br>

    <p>They say a journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step. 
        I believe that the true glory lies in the magic that happens before that; choosing to say yes to one self and having the zeal to step into the unknown. 
        That pretty much summarizes my journey into tech. I have always been intrigued by technology and yearned to delve deeper into that space. 
        However before taking that step, I had some doubts and uncertainties stemming from intrinsic and extrinsic factors.</p>
        <br>

    <p>I took a leap of faith regardless, and I'm beyond glad that I did because my single step exposed me to a world of opportunities and endless possibilities. 
        This journey is a continuous learning and improvement of my journey despite the hurdles. 
        ALU has given me the experience which has made the two years worthwhile. 
        They said, you choose a mission not a major. 
        You engage with a pan African community and join a great network for life. 
        You learn through hands-on, real-world experiences and have a great group of peers. 
        You create history as part of the leaders who transformed Africa. 
        You get access to an affordable education, thus I got a full ride scholarship. </p>
        <br>

    <p>I got a part time study work experience with ALU. Working as a residential Advisor, I had learnt a lot of things. 
        From organizing events to monitoring students and giving them the best campus life. 
        ALU gave me the opportunity to meet and connect with people from all across the African continent in a way I would never have experienced elsewhere. 
        The events held at school were very engaging and I got to learn different cultures. 
        There is a lot of diversity amongst us students and everyone has something unique they offer.</p>
        <br>

    <p>People are more interested in what you build than in what you say. 
        I love computers and technology in general because it almost incomprehensibly altered the human situation. 
        For example, aircraft, robots, communication, and the list goes on. 
        It is beautiful how studying computers and all that it entails can entangle itself into engineering, business, and even bring new technology into existence. 
        All these bring me down to exactly my passions about computers, how to solve problems through programming, coding, and making elegant designs that can help people out there maneuver through their day-to-day activities. 
        It is a beautiful and yet amazing experience when done right with a lot of passion.</p>
        <br>


    <p>This passion sparked when I was back in my village. 
        I saw how girls were being forced to marry and they ended up dropping out of school because my community believes that girls are meant to stay at home and take care of the family. 
        That is when I got an interest in helping my community to learn and engage in technological advancements as we are moving to a new era of technology. 
        Educating young girls who are already married and cannot find a loophole to get out of it. This is my mission at ALU.

    <p>I was studying Computer Science at Africa Nazarene University before coming to ALU. I launched an application that I calculated would make me a millionaire in a week. And a billionaire in a matter of months. The app gained over a thousand users in less than a week, which was great progress, but I was blind to it at the time because I wanted hundreds of thousands of users. I contacted several departments, but none responded. I was hurt and decided to look for a place abroad where I could receive support to further my mission.When I ran into a close friend who advised me to add key features to the app, I decided to pull it down, develop a super upgrade, and relaunch it later.</p>



        <p>
            <br>
        I went on Google and typed in "how to get a scholarship outside of Kenya." I submitted an application to one university in the United States. They offered me a partial scholarship of $1000 and asked me to pay the remaining $9000. That is a large sum of money, but I did not give up. I arrived at a website. Admissions were closed, but they had a form where I could fill out my personal information. I went on to teach science in a high school. I received an email from ALU in February with a link to apply for a fully funded scholarship. I immediately clicked on the link. I had a feeling I'd be admitted. I looked up ALU on Google and YouTube. After reading several testimonies and watching a Ted talk by Fred Swaniker, I knew this was it.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
        It took several weeks to complete the application process. I had to turn in essays and academic papers. I received an email congratulating me on being conditionally admitted a month later. I later uploaded my original academic documents and was accepted unconditionally. Because of my admission status, I was able to apply for the scholarship. I waited after submitting essays and financial documents. During the Covid partial lockdown, I received an email informing me that I had been awarded a full scholarship. I was overjoyed. I applied for a passport and provided information for a visa application. The process took some time but was completed successfully.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
        Admissions were pushed back to January. As I awaited my departure date, I returned to teaching sciences. The dates came and went, and I boarded my first flight. This is an experience I will never forget. We arrived and were quarantined for the first two weeks. We then went to campus. Mauritius is a fantastic destination. The natural beauty and tranquility. I used to love going to the mall, and I still do. The core leadership sessions were excellent. They unlocked a particular line of thought. Sometimes you learn without realizing it until the sessions are offered and you begin reflecting back.

    <p> In my perspective, a self - leadership journey is a good method to describe and discuss people's backgrounds, interests, and experiences. 
        As for me, I believe that the most straightforward aspect of this trip is sharing every single key occasion, such as the excellent choice I made, my plans for my future career, and even my dreams at various stages. 
        Otherwise, I find that thinking about my fears and shortcomings is the most difficult section. 
        We constantly want the others to know that we are the strongest and most powerful people because people occasionally don't want to face and display their weakness.

    </p>
    <br>

    <p>I'll be honest: I didn't have much leadership experience until I commenced my computing major in January 2021. 
        Being a representative, which I served for only one month before resigning, came the closest to demonstrating my leadership qualities. 
        I have one of those resumes that raises red flags with employers because of the variety of jobs listed on it. Fortunately, I've always had a chance. 
        The many roles I've held have given me a variety of educational possibilities and assisted me in polishing the talents I currently hold. 
        I have faith in my skills. </p>
        <br>

    <p>I quickly acquired leadership and entrepreneurship skills, including knowledge of projects, data and decisions, and introductions to global challenges, after enrolling at ALU. 
        It was an opportunity that immediately piqued my interest. I had to create a personal mission statement as part of the "introduction to global challenges" course. 
        This has aided me in focusing on a certain objective. I had been placed in a team for most of my classes, but I was dubious of both my ability to lead others and, more significantly, how to think like a leader. 
        This sounded like the final piece of the jigsaw puzzle, which I eventually discovered.</p>
        <br>

        <p>I've started to grasp the kind of leader I am and the traits that determine my leadership style through both my education and the chances that have been offered.
             I've learned that I enjoy stepping outside of my comfort zone and that I'm a sincere, trustworthy person who likes to set an example for others. 
             I appreciate the chance to meet new people, network, and widen my circle of acquaintances, and these programs have definitely met all of my expectations. 
             I add a piece to my jigsaw puzzle with each connection! 
            At the current time, leadership is required in computer science at all levels, and I am grateful for the opportunities I have had.</p>

        Coming to Alu was largely influenced by the non-traditional learning model which I hoped would give me Academic value beyond the classroom set up. I was intrigued by the prospect of getting hands -on experience and interacting with tens of other different cultures within an African context.
        </p>
        <p>
        The Leadership core curriculum opened my eyes to the reality of the world of careers. Besides getting vital workplace skills in the Data and Decisions course, I opened myself to a new world of possibilities through the Global Challenges unit which was my favorite. Learning the Sustainable Development Goals with a focus to solve the most pressing problems on the African continent was both interesting and engaging.
        </p>
        <p>
        I have also been able to pursue political pursuits as a student representative for the MasterCard Foundation scholars. This role changed me as a person, from learning to engage large groups of students to drafting demands and expectations.  The rollercoaster of responsibilities has sharpened my mental faculties and decision making skills beyond anything I could have thought. In addition I have been able to take up roles as a collaborator and conservation fellow with the ALU school of Wildlife and Conservation, this non elective role has enabled me to build significant discussions around conservation, not just at ALU but in Kenya as well. Finally, on non academic responsibility, I chaired the Global Challenge Club. This club is centered around discussions on world politics and the possible solutions to existing social, economic and political problems on the continent.
        </p>
        <p>
        My interest in computing is mostly based on my attraction to developing technologies. Despite not finding a particular niche, I am drawn to Web Development and design and will be looking to focus my energy in this line of tech for the foreseeable future. Beyond the career prospects, I love to understand how things work in the technological world, From the metaverse to NFTs. I believe that the future has intriguing surprises technologically and I feel compelled to be within this space both to anticipate and experience the future as it comes.
